I read a fair number of magazines. I read 10-Ks. I read annual reports. I read a lot of other things, too. I’ve always enjoyed reading. I love reading biographies, for example.",

Taken aback, he headed to Russia to see if he could buy a rocket himself. After being pushed around with ridiculous prices, Elon dove into books studying how rockets are built. On their plane ride home from Russia, he declared he would build the rocket himself with a spreadsheet detailing how to do it. This was how SpaceX was born.",

        content: "In the digital age, as we become increasingly reliant on technology, tech support scams have emerged as a pervasive threat. These scams exploit our dependence on computers and smartphones, tricking unsuspecting users into parting with their money or personal information. Tech support scams typically involve fraudsters posing as technical support representatives from well-known companies like Microsoft, Apple, or Google. These scammers contact victims through various means, including phone calls, pop-up messages, emails, or even social media. They claim that the victim’s device is infected with a virus, running slow, or experiencing other issues that need immediate attention. Once the victim is convinced of the supposed problem, the scammer may request remote access to their device, trick them into installing malicious software, or ask for payment for unnecessary services. The end goal is to steal sensitive information, install malware, or extort money.",

        content: "The software industry is on the cusp of a revolution, thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI). While AI’s potential is widely recognized, its impact on software business models is still largely untapped. Traditionally, software has focused on enabling existing work, but AI-enabled software can deliver outcomes, transforming the way businesses operate.The dominant SaaS business model is currently based on a per-seat model, limiting growth potential. However, AI-powered software can deliver specific business outcomes, unconstrained by employee usage. This shift unlocks new markets, enabling software to reach small businesses, under-resourced teams, and new geographies.The implications are significant. AI will expand Total Addressable Markets (TAM) in various categories, enabling niche categories to expand and large categories to grow further. New monetization variables will emerge, as businesses will pay for outcomes rather than just software.",
